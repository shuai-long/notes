1. 调用工资核算程序

   ```abap
       submit hcncalc0
        with pnpxabkr = p_xabkr
        with pnptimra = 'X'
        with pnptimr9 = ' '
        with pnppabrp = p_abrp0
        with pnppabrj = p_abrj0
        with pnppernr in pnppernr
        with pnpabkrs in pnpabkrs
        with schema   = 'ZN28'
        with tst_on   = 'X'
        with test     = 'NOUPD/RT/OFF' "程序中有判断 test 中包含 RT 会抛内存出来
        with ecalled  = 'X'  "保存缓冲区到内存中
        with sw_spool = ' '  "使用提交启动的计算
        with prt_prot = ' '  "不打印日志
        and return.
   
   ```

2. 获取内存值

   ```abap
   data rt type table of pc207 with header line.
   import rt = rt from memory id 'RT'.
   free memory id 'RT'.
   ```
